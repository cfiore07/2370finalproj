After rigorous testing we have not seen any errors from our code.

Dealing with version issues did lead to several non-obvious problems when we shared
our work through git. This may cause problems when shared with you in this zip file.

For that reason we recommend using java version 23.0.2 and the standard SDK libraries to avoid
compatibility issues from deprecated java versions.

Overall this assignment was fairly straightforward, and we didn't struggle much with implementation
however, we did learn a good bit about how to use gradle and java compiling. These
things will likely serve us well in the future.

The initial implementation of the compute method probably took, the longest to implement,
however it was not so much difficulty and more so confusion on requirements around implementation
that slowed us down.
